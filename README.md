A simple color picker that output hexadecimal color code.

## How to Use

The hexadecimal color code at the middle of the hexagon shape represents its color value, but the text itself is in oposite color. The color randomly change on page reload.

There are three buttons each represents "red", "green", and "blue", when clicked they prompt user with a request for a integer from 0~255; said channel of RGB color will change according to user input value. There are also three sliders that control RGB values individually.

At the bottom are four functional buttons. The "plus" and "minus" buttons increment or decrement all channels' values by 1. The "refresh" button randomly change the color code on click, and finally there is the "copy" button that copy current color code to the clipboard for ease of use.
